Hello there! My name is Colin Lynch, and I am a postdoctoral fellow at Arizona State University. I primarily leverage industrial engineering techniques to design optimal experiments for the study of emergence in complex adaptive systems, and I am looking to use these techniques to acquire a data science position in R&D. I am specifically interested in reducing research costs by developing optimization methods that minimize sample size while still having a rich enough dataset to perform inferential and predictive analytics. I also use simulations to validate these approaches and to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms that drive complicated systems.   

This portfolio is a demonstration of how I use Python, R, MATLAB, JMP, and Netlogo to analyze and model data in domains ranging from biology, archaeology, and business. Examples for how I use different methodologies to address different types of problems are linked below, but if time is of the essence, please see this [repository](https://github.com/colinmichaellynch/End-to-End-Ant-Data-Project) for how I have synthesized many of these skills into a single project. Also see my [ResearchGate] (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/C-Lynch) page to see some of my research publications.
