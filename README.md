### Profile Overview

Hello there! My name is Colin Lynch, and I am an animal behavior Ph.D. candidate at Arizona State University. I primarily leverage industrial engineering techniques to design optimal experiments for the study of emergence in complex adaptive systems, and I am looking to use these techniques to aquire a data science internship in R&D. I am specifically interested in reducing research costs by developing optimization methods that minimize sample size while still having a rich enough dataset to perform hypothesis tests and predictive analytics. I also use simulations to validate these approaches and to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms  

The projects housed within these repositories demonstrate 

Selecting sample size (1, 2, 3)
Validation Simulations (1, 2) 
Mechanistic Simulations
    Mcmc, discrete event, multi agent 
Machine Learning: Clustering
Machine Learning: Classification 
Data Analytics 
   Survival analysis, GLM, lmm, time series
Optimization 
   Simplex, Pareto, normalized sum 
Python
MATLAB
R
Response surface methodology 

ALSO ADD: Netlogo, nate threshold, fiverr, evan project?
